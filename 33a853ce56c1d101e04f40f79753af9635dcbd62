      "message": "as I know - code of this plugin must be present in container with neutron-server. Same case we have for lbaas.\nlbaas extension is enabled by contrail-neutron-plugin itself.\n\nBut not all set of containers have such libraries inside neutron-server. I know that both sets of containers for helm do not contain lbaas library there. Therefore we need to workaround it by bringing lbaas code with our neutron-init container.\n\nDoes it work at least for all kolla containers sets/versions?",
