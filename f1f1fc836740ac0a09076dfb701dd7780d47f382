      "message": "1) I checked experimentally that this step fails for all values if nova is not available.\n\n2) I tried to locate, where those host aggregates are used. I couldn\u0027t find any place.\n\n3) This step was created two years ago by Nitish Krishna. Unfortunately he has already left Juniper, so I couldn\u0027t ask him about his intention. This was supposed to be a fix for a bug #1783692, but old bugs from Launchpad are not available anymore.\n\n4) I checked experimentally that with this patch I could deploy CEM without compute nodes. A few basic tests didn\u0027t reveal any problems with CFM-related activities (CFM-only deployments are the reason why we want to have deployments without compute nodes).",
